# KickTools Docs Launched!

Welcome to the official **KickTools Documentation**!

<!-- truncate -->

We’re excited to announce the launch of our new docs site! The KickTools Docs are now live, providing everything you need to get started with our tools and services.

To kick things off, we’re starting with two comprehensive guides:

- **Hype Train Guide**: Everything you need to know about getting started with the Hype Train feature on Kick.
- **Spotibot Guide**: Learn how to set up and optimize your Spotibot integration for a better experience.

This is just the beginning, and we'll be adding more guides and resources to help you make the most of KickTools. Stay tuned for future updates!

Thank you for being part of the KickTools community. We can’t wait to see what you’ll create with our tools!
