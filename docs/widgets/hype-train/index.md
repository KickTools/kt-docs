# Hype Train v3 Guide

Welcome to the KickTools Hype Train Version 3! This latest version introduces an exciting new leveling and points system to enhance engagement and competitiveness in the Kick streaming community.

---

## Overview

The Hype Train requires **21 points** to activate, with points earned through subscriptions and gifted subscriptions (soon to include Kicks). Points are awarded as follows:

- A **unique subscription** earns **10 points**.
- **Gifted subscriptions** work as follows:
  - First gift: 10 points + 1 point per gifted sub.
  - Second gift: 5 points + 1 point per gifted sub.
  - Subsequent gifts: 3 points + 1 point per gifted sub.

### Bonus Points
Earn additional bonus points by gifting subs in specific increments:
- Gift **10 subs**: +1 bonus point.
- Gift **25 subs**: +4 bonus points.
- Gift **50 subs**: +11 bonus points.
- Gift **100 subs**: +25 bonus points.

These bonus points contribute to the overall Hype Train totals, incentivizing both community members and streamers to gift more subs at once.

This system ensures balance in the leaderboards, preventing a single viewer from dominating and rewarding more unique subs and gifters.

## Hype Train Modes

KickTools Hype Train Version 3 features two exciting modes:

### **Normal Mode**
- Starts with a **5-minute countdown**.
- Each sub or gifted sub resets the timer as the train levels up.
- The train continues as long as subs or gifts occur within the 5-minute window.

### **Extreme Mode**
- Also starts with a **5-minute countdown**.
- The timer only resets when a new level is reached.
- This mode is ideal for larger streamers or those seeking a more challenging experience.

## New Leaderboards

Hype Train v3 introduces brand-new leaderboards designed to spark activity and excitement in the streaming community. These leaderboards track:

- **Top Train** (based on points).
- **Top Sub and Gift Sub Contributors**.
- **Longest Hype Trains**.
- **Most Passengers** (unique subs and gifters).

Individual streamer and viewer leaderboards are also available. These leaderboards aim to set new Hype Train records and drive community engagement.

> Note: Original leaderboards from previous versions will remain on the KickTools site but will be deprecated in favor of this new system.
